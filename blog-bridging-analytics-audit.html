    <p>
      When I describe my career interests, I often mention two areas that sound different
      at first: data analytics and internal auditing. For some people, analytics belongs
      to data science teams, while audit is associated with policies, compliance, and
      documentation. I see them as deeply connected. In fact, my goal is to build a
      profile that stands exactly at the intersection of both.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Why analytics matters to audit</h2>
    <p>
      Internal auditing is ultimately about providing assurance and insight. To do that
      well, auditors need to understand how processes operate in practice, not just how
      they are described in manuals. Data analytics offers a way to observe that reality
      at scale. By analyzing full populations of transactions, user activities, or system
      events, auditors can identify control weaknesses, emerging risks, and behavioral
      patterns that would be impossible to see through sampling alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      This does not mean that every auditor must become a programmer, but it does mean
      that teams benefit from having members who are comfortable with SQL, scripting,
      visualization tools, and statistical thinking. That is where I hope to contribute.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Why audit matters to analytics</h2>
    <p>
      At the same time, analytics without context can easily become disconnected from the
      real objectives of the organization. Internal audit brings a strong framework for
      thinking about risk, governance, and controls. It asks questions such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Which risks are most significant to the organization’s objectives?</li>
      <li>How are responsibilities and decision rights structured?</li>
      <li>What controls exist, and how do they operate?</li>
      <li>Where could errors, fraud, or non-compliance occur?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When analytics is guided by these questions, it becomes much more focused. Instead
      of generating random charts, the analysis is aligned with a clear purpose:
      supporting the assurance and advisory role of internal audit.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Building the bridge in my own learning</h2>
    <p>
      My academic and practical experiences have pushed me to develop both sides of this
      bridge. Through coursework and projects, I have worked with tools like R, Python,
      SQL, and Power BI to clean data, build models, and create dashboards. At the same
      time, I am investing in my understanding of risk management, internal controls,
      and the standards that guide the internal audit profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preparing for the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) exams is part of this journey.
      The CIA framework covers governance, risk, control, and audit practices. By pairing
      that knowledge with my technical skills, I want to be able to design analytics
      that are not just technically correct, but also relevant, defensible, and aligned
      with professional standards.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">How this perspective shapes my projects</h2>
    <p>
      In my portfolio, many of the dashboards may look like general analytics projects:
      wildlife activity, ocean health, or island logistics. Behind each of them is also
      an audit perspective. I am interested in questions such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where are the anomalies or outliers?</li>
      <li>What indicators could serve as early warnings?</li>
      <li>How could this dashboard support monitoring by a control function?</li>
      <li>What decisions would a risk or audit professional want to make from this view?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By practicing this mindset, I hope to build a habit of always connecting analytics
      to assurance and governance.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Long-term aspirations</h2>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I see strong demand for professionals who can translate complex
      data into insights that inform boards, audit committees, and senior management.
      Organizations operate in increasingly data-rich environments, and internal audit
      functions are expected to keep pace with that complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to contribute to this evolution, whether as an internal
      auditor, an analytics specialist within an audit team, or a leader in risk and
      assurance functions. Bridging data analytics and internal auditing is not just
      a personal preference; I believe it is part of the future shape of the profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      This portfolio is one step in that direction. It reflects my effort to grow in
      both domains and to develop a profile that can bring analytical depth to audit,
      and audit discipline to analytics.
