    <p>
      My first experience with data analysis did not involve dashboards or interactive
      visuals. It began, as it does for many people, with spreadsheets. I spent hours
      arranging tables, building formulas, and carefully formatting cells to make a report
      as clear as possible. Those exercises taught me the basics of structure, accuracy,
      and attention to detail, but they also showed me the limits of static reporting.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Why static reports were not enough</h2>
    <p>
      As the volume of data grows, static spreadsheets become harder to maintain and even
      harder to interpret. Stakeholders often want to slice the data in different ways:
      by region, product, time period, or customer segment. A single spreadsheet cannot
      easily answer all of those questions, and building a new file for every request is
      time-consuming and prone to error.
    </p>
    <p>
      I realized that I needed tools that could do more than calculate. I wanted to
      explore trends, drill into details, and give decision-makers the ability to see
      the same data from multiple perspectives. That is what led me to business
      intelligence platforms such as Power BI.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Learning to think in models and visuals</h2>
    <p>
      Moving from spreadsheets to dashboards required a shift in the way I think about
      data. Instead of focusing on individual sheets, I began to think in terms of
      data models: tables, relationships, measures, and filters. The process of cleaning,
      transforming, and connecting data became just as important as the final charts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visualization was another learning curve. A good dashboard is not just colorful;
      it is intentional. Each chart has a purpose: to show a trend, highlight an outlier,
      compare categories, or track a key performance indicator. I started asking myself:
      what question is this visual answering, and is there a simpler way to tell the story?
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Designing for decision-makers</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most valuable lessons from my BI journey has been the importance of
      designing for the person who will use the dashboard. Executives, auditors, and
      operational managers often look at the same data with different priorities.
      An internal auditor might want to see unusual behavior and potential control gaps,
      while a manager might be focused on performance against targets.
    </p>
    <p>
      When building dashboards, I try to clarify:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who is the primary audience?</li>
      <li>What decisions will they make using this information?</li>
      <li>Which metrics are truly critical versus “nice to have”?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Answering these questions helps me choose the right visuals and avoid clutter.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Connecting BI with internal audit</h2>
    <p>
      As someone transitioning into internal auditing, I see a special opportunity in
      combining BI with assurance work. Dashboards can support continuous monitoring
      of key control indicators, highlight exceptions in real time, and make audit
      findings easier to communicate. Instead of presenting results only in lengthy
      reports, auditors can use dashboards to guide conversations and show patterns
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my own portfolio projects, such as the wildlife, ocean, and logistics dashboards,
      I have experimented with these ideas: using visuals not only to display numbers
      but to support questions about risk, efficiency, and performance.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Next steps in my BI development</h2>
    <p>
      My learning path is still ongoing. I want to deepen my skills in data modeling,
      DAX formulas, and advanced visual design. I am also interested in integrating
      BI with other technologies, such as Python scripts for data preparation or
      APIs for automated data refresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey from spreadsheets to dashboards has already transformed the way I
      think about data. It pushed me to go beyond static reports and build tools that
      invite exploration, curiosity, and better decision-making. That is the direction
      I will keep pursuing as I grow in both business intelligence and internal audit.
